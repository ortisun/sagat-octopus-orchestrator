# Research & Decisions: Durable execution engine and scheduler

## Main decision

Planner reduces events into a pure state machine; scheduler uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and fencing in transactions; outbox dispatcher sends hints to JetStream; worker protocol confirms via Command API.

## Rationale

Ensure DAG progress, checkpoints, suspension, retries and failure recovery without re-executing commits. The decision respects the recovery, auditability, security and versioning properties defined in the Constitution.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Generic ad hoc queue-based solution:** rejected as the sole durability mechanism, since message delivery is not equivalent to a transaction over workflow state.
2. **Independent services per feature from day 1:** postponed to avoid operational and consistency complexity without a benchmark.
3. **SDK-specific logic:** rejected for core invariants, to avoid behavior differences between languages.

## Risks and mitigation

- Complexity/scope risk: deliver P1 user stories separately, running contract tests.
- Semantic ambiguity risk: encode reducers and golden fixtures, do not decide via UI alone.
- Crash/redelivery risk: test harness with real failures at checkpoints.
- Security risk: specific pentest and tenant isolation from the first milestone.

## Questions for spike validation

- Latency and overhead benchmarks on the critical path defined for this feature.
- Detail compliance and retention requirements according to the deployment environment.
