# Research: workflow primitives

**Date**: 2026-10-14. Decisions below are a proposed design, not runtime evidence or accepted ADRs.

## Baseline verified in this repository

| Evidence | Consequence for 014 |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/domain/src/workflow.rs`: `NodeKind`, acyclic validation, `MAX_BRANCHES=256`, `MAX_NODES=10000`, `MAX_WAIT=366 days` | Retain DAG invariants and upper bounds; dynamic bodies need explicit instance identity, not graph back-edges. |
| `crates/domain/src/execution/plan.rs`: `join_outcome`, `settle_joins` | Static `all` and first-success `any` already exist. Neither is newly implemented here. |
| `crates/domain/src/execution/state.rs`: run statuses and event reducer | No `CONTINUED` status exists; an additive completion kind avoids silently expanding the status enum seen by old clients. |
| `specs/001-platform-foundation/contracts/workflow.schema.json`, `crates/infra-ir/` | Wire IR is separate from domain rules. Proposed new fields remain local to 014 until contracts are approved. |
| ADR-0002, ADR-0014, ADR-0020 | Reuse authoritative database transactions, cancellation-safe transaction start and scheduler owner fencing. |
| ADR-0015, `tests/contract/sdk-conformance/` | All five SDK public APIs must match a reviewed common golden, including faults. TypeScript is not a semantic reference. |
| `specs/012-developer-experience/`, `examples/hello-world/`, `examples/payment-saga/` | Add a practical three-workflow example on current APIs; do not fabricate a loop/approval API for demonstration. |
| FR-003-002, ADR-0005, ADR-0010, `crates/domain/src/saga.rs` (`reverse_dependencies`) | Compensation is planned in reverse topological order and respects branch independence; it is not reverse completion order. Iteration compensation refines this rule (R2). |
| ADR-0028, `Run` schema in `openapi.yaml` (no output field) | The API discloses no payload value, only authorized structure; value disclosure needs a new decision. Query/Update results depend on it (R4). |
| `Error` schema in `openapi.yaml`, `crates/api-http/src/error.rs` | `Error.code` is a closed enum of ten values; refinements are `details.reason` (`IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`, `REVISION_CONFLICT`, `ALREADY_DECIDED`, `STATE_CONFLICT`, `UNSUPPORTED_NODE`…). New errors add reasons, not codes. |
| `crates/domain/src/identity.rs` (`Role`), feature 009 G39, feature 013 (federated login) | Six built-in roles, no custom roles; 013 excludes mapping identity-provider groups to roles. Approval eligibility can name subjects and built-in roles only (R3). |
| `Run.version` / `expectedRunVersion` in `openapi.yaml` | The run's existing optimistic-concurrency token counts every journal event. Update uses a state revision instead, so unrelated work does not cause conflicts (R4). |
| `crates/application/src/runs.rs` (`signal`), `signalRun` in `openapi.yaml` | A signal is accepted only by a waiting step and consumed in that transaction; it is never buffered. There is no pending-signal state for continuation to drain (R5). |
| `crates/application/src/execution.rs` (`MAX_TREE_RUNS` = 1024), `Run.depth` ≤ 8 | Every run created under one root counts. Children inside bodies and child-chain successors consume this budget (R5, R6). |
| `Run.rerunOf` (RERUN_AS_NEW), ADR-0012, ADR-0016, ADR-0017, ADR-0023, ADR-0027 | Existing rerun lineage, durable inbox, journal-derived graph and telemetry, blob claim-check and durable content/rate/retention quotas: reused, not replaced. |

## R1 — Structured bodies, not structural cycles

**Decision**: Add named, closed acyclic bodies and durable scope/iteration identities. A body may
contain ordinary nodes and nested bounded scopes; its completion uses a body return boundary, not a
workflow `end`. Each activation is uniquely `(run, enclosing instance path, definition node)`.

**Rationale**: Today's reducer keys ordinary steps by node identity. Reusing a node id for every
iteration would merge results, leases and compensation records. Explicit identities let replay
retain previous iterations without mutating an immutable definition.

**Alternatives**: Graph back-edges weaken publication validation and require a different execution
model. Expanding all iterations at publication cannot handle runtime inputs. Hosting an imperative
loop in an activity hides checkpoints and cancellation from the engine. The proposed ADR records
identity/storage cost; acceptance and measurements remain tasks T014-002/T014-042.

## R2 — Collection semantics and loop budgets

**Decision**: `forEach` is the collection node; `map` is an SDK convenience selecting each body
result. Both use stable input indices, an immutable input snapshot, bounded concurrency and fail-fast
admission with drain. `while` is pre-test and `repeatUntil` post-test, both sequential with explicit
carried state, `maxIterations`, deadline and optional between-iteration timer.

**Rationale**: Ordered results and per-instance effect keys remove dependence on completion order.
Empty collections return `[]`; false initial `while` returns the initial carry; exhausted limits
are failures. Slots remain occupied until the iteration is terminal or safely reconciled, so a
lost lease cannot exceed concurrency through premature release. No collect-all failure mode, break,
continue, mutable iterator source or streaming collection is promised in the first increment.

Compensation keeps FR-003-002 instead of inventing a global completion order: within an iteration,
the body's reverse topological order; between collection iterations, none (they are independent
branches and may compensate concurrently within the concurrency limit); between loop iterations,
reverse iteration order, since each depends on the previous carry. This refines ADR-0005 and is
accepted with the ADR in T014-002.

**Alternatives**: Best-effort cancellation plus immediate success could conceal effects. Unbounded
fanout cannot respect tenant capacity. Merely reusing `parallel` does not give dynamic membership or
bounded admission. AWS's documented Inline Map distinguishes per-item iteration and a concurrency
limit; this supports separating membership from admission but its limits/implementation are not
copied into Sagat. [AWS Inline Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/state-map-inline.html).

## R3 — Approval is a first-class authorized decision

**Decision**: One eligible decision wins. Snapshot the allowed subjects/role identifiers and
initiator at activation; evaluate current membership and authorization when deciding. Exclude the
initiator by default. A timer makes expiry eligible; response/expiry/cancel serialize on the same
request/run. First committed outcome wins, including a response after the nominal deadline if the
expiry transition has not committed. This is deliberate first-commit behavior, not wall-clock
priority. Decision routes are approve/reject/expire, with cancellation handled by the enclosing run.

**Rationale**: A generic signal proves neither the decision-maker's permission nor separation of
duties. A persisted policy prevents a later definition publication from altering a pending request;
current RBAC prevents a revoked member from using an old pending request.

**Eligibility vocabulary**: roles are the six built-in ones (G39 accepted no custom roles) and
feature 013 does not map identity-provider groups to roles. A policy therefore lists subjects and,
optionally, `admin`/`developer`/`operator`; a business approver group ("finance approvers") is
expressed by listing its subjects until a role or group feature exists. New permissions
`approval:read`/`approval:decide` follow the `resource:action` form; their role grants are proposed
in `contracts/README.md` and accepted in T014-002.

**Alternatives**: Quorum/delegation/escalation introduces additional identity and race rules and is
out of scope. Existing publishing approval (ADR-0018) approves a document, not a running workflow;
its resource/permissions must not be reused as if they were interchangeable.

## R4 — Query and Update are declarative state operations

**Decision**: Define a schema-checked business state initialized at run creation. Query evaluates a
bounded side-effect-free expression against one committed snapshot. Update validates arguments,
optionally checks an expected state revision, computes a new state and return value, and commits
state, receipt and journal atomically. Neither runs arbitrary SDK code. Reads work on terminal runs
while retained; new updates are allowed only in RUNNING/WAITING.

**Corrections from validation**: (1) the concurrency token is the state revision, not the run's
journal position: `Run.version`/`expectedRunVersion` already exists and moves on every activity
completion or timer, so using it would make interactive updates conflict with unrelated work.
Query returns both values under their existing/explicit names. (2) An Update schedules nothing: no
node waits on a state predicate and no node assigns state, so "work enabled by an update" had no
mechanism. Whether to add either is a pending decision, not part of the first increment. (3) Query
and Update return business values through the API, which ADR-0028 does not permit today; US06 needs
an accepted value-disclosure decision before release.

**Rationale**: This follows the graph-native boundary (ADR-0003) without inventing replay of arbitrary
procedural code or executing customer code in a scheduler. Valid business rejections are durable
receipts, enabling safe retries after lost responses. Authorization is rechecked before exposing a
stored receipt. Query's read audit is separate from the workflow journal and cannot activate work.

**Alternatives**: Async Update handlers that launch activities/wait would need a new operation
lifecycle, cancellation protocol and pending-handler shutdown policy. Temporal documents handler
concurrency and the need to finish handlers before workflow exit; that is a useful hazard inventory,
not evidence that Sagat implements Temporal's semantics. The first Sagat increment therefore uses
only bounded atomic reducers. [Temporal message handling](https://docs.temporal.io/handling-messages).

## R5 — Continue-As-New closes a segment without changing old status enums

**Decision**: A `continueAsNew` boundary ends the old run as `SUCCEEDED` with additive
`completionKind=CONTINUED`, and atomically creates a new run in the same chain with the same pinned
version. Normal success uses `completionKind=FINAL`. Link predecessor/successor and update the head
in that transaction. Child completion notification is suppressed until the chain's final outcome.
Quiescence excludes outstanding activities, timers, subscriptions, approvals, unresolved outcomes
and compensation obligations. Only explicitly transferred input/state is copied. The original chain
deadline and tenant accounting survive; a chain has a finite configured segment limit.

Signals need no drain at the boundary: a signal is accepted only by a step waiting for it and is
consumed in that transaction, so an open wait (which already blocks handoff) is the only message
obligation; a chain-targeted signal to a head that is not waiting is refused, never held. A child
chain's successors are runs of the parent's tree and consume its 1,024-run budget. RERUN_AS_NEW of
any segment starts an unrelated run with `rerunOf`; chain lineage is a separate link.

**Rationale**: A terminal run never reopens. Existing clients can still parse `SUCCEEDED`, but must
use the additive chain fields to determine whether the business process finished. This limitation
is documented and tested before enabling a workflow that continues. Version migration is excluded
until its compatibility and authorization contract is separately approved.

**Alternatives**: A new terminal status is a possible future major-contract choice but breaks clients
that exhaustively parse the present enum. Resetting the same run erases history. Automatically
following old-run writes risks directing an operation to an unintended segment. Temporal describes
fresh histories and different run IDs within a chain; we adopt the explicit-chain concept, not its
infinite continuation/versioning guarantees. [Temporal Continue-As-New](https://docs.temporal.io/workflow-execution/continue-as-new).

## R6 — Limits are explicit design values, not capacity claims

**Decision**: Hard publication ceilings: 10,000 items/loop iterations, concurrency 256, nesting depth
8, 100,000 activated node instances per run, 32 cases per switch, 32 operations of each Query/Update
kind, 32 approval principals/roles per policy, 10,000 segments per chain, and the existing 366-day
wait ceiling. Tenant policies may lower these. Runtime inline state/results retain existing limits
(256 KiB value, 4 MiB retained run data, 8 MiB task context); large collections use authorized blob
references without bypassing byte/node budgets. Run creation captures effective limits; policy
reductions block additional admissions but never erase accepted work or prevent draining it.
The existing child-run tree budget (1,024 runs, depth 8) still applies, so a collection whose body
starts a child is effectively bounded by it, whatever `maxItems` allows.

**Rationale**: Explicit values make rejection/overflow tests possible. They are conservative design
ceilings to validate before implementation release; T014-042 must measure cost and may propose
lower values, with contracts/tests updated together. No throughput claim is inferred from a ceiling.

## R7 — Compatibility and release sequence

**Decision**: Keep existing IR v1 behavior unchanged; a separately negotiated IR revision introduces
new nodes, scoped task identity and declared state. Worker protocol uses an additive next available
minor only after checking the baseline (currently 1.4); do not assign a potentially conflicting minor
in this proposal. Existing root-node identities and older-minor workers remain supported for old
workflows. New scoped tasks require a supporting worker minor; they are never flattened and handed
to an old worker. Claim and replay use the pinned IR revision.

**Rationale**: Neither a TypeScript-only builder nor a silently permissive parser establishes five
SDK parity. Design acceptance, canonical contracts, migrations, fault suites and all-five conformance
precede advertising each primitive. Examples using today's APIs can be delivered independently now.

## Product decisions to confirm

These choices were made while specifying, without a `/speckit-clarify` session. They are
reasonable defaults for a bounded first increment, but they are the product owner's to confirm
before T014-002 accepts the ADR:

1. Collections fail fast on the first permanent iteration failure; there is no collect-all mode.
2. One eligible decision settles an approval; no quorum, delegation or escalation.
3. The initiator is excluded from deciding by default.
4. An approval decision carries an optional `reasonCode` (1..64 ASCII), never free text.
5. Query/Update are declarative expressions only; no asynchronous handler that runs activities.
6. Only Updates change declared state; no node assigns state or waits on it.
7. Continue-As-New keeps the same pinned version; no cross-version continuation.
8. Ceilings: 10,000 items/iterations, concurrency 256, depth 8, 100,000 instances per run, 32 cases,
   32 queries and 32 updates, 32 approval principals, 10,000 segments per chain.
9. The scope of one feature: six runtime capabilities. Query/Update and Continue-As-New are each
   feature-sized; splitting them into separate features is an option that the plan's per-primitive
   release gates already allow.

## Remaining gates, not unanswered semantics

Pending decisions, each recorded where it applies: the value-disclosure decision for Query/Update
results (refines ADR-0028; blocks US06 release), the iteration compensation rule (refines
ADR-0005), the role grants of the new permissions, and the confirmations above. The proposed ADR is
pending acceptance; production limits need measurement; new contracts/engine/SDK code and their
runtime tests are unimplemented. These are explicit future tasks, not claims that a design artifact
proves them. External sources were read on 2026-10-14; all normative Sagat decisions are local
proposals.
