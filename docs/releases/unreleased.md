# Unreleased integration changes

These changes are on the project completion feature branch. This is not a published release.
Final compatibility, fault, canary, performance and workspace gates remain in the feature tasks.

## Breaking: event detail values require an explicit reveal

`getInboxEvent` omits `data` by default. `getConnectorDeadLetter` omits `body` and `headers` by
default. Their structural metadata remains available to authorized event readers.
`listConnectorDeadLetters` never returns body or header values.

Detail values require `reveal=pii`, `event:read`, current `payload:read-internal`, and a payload
reveal grant in that namespace. Admin also needs an explicit grant. Every successful reveal is
audited before values are returned; responses are private and non-cacheable. Clients must handle
the absent value fields and must not treat a saved grant as a broader role permission.

See [the events runbook](../runbooks/events.md) and
[payload classification](../runbooks/payload-classification.md).

## Classified workflow values

New workflow versions pin classification interpretation rules 1. Existing versions remain at
rules 0 and disclose no values through the new endpoint. Values use the pinned carrier's schema;
`secret` is never disclosed. Workflow input, workflow result and eligible journal outputs use the
explicit payload disclosure operation; existing structural inspection retains its purpose.

## Combined worker protocol

The integrated protocol is 1.6: scoped identity was introduced in 1.5 and managed database
capabilities in 1.6. Ordinary workers retain the documented feature gates. Do not reuse the
standalone unreleased 017 migration numbering against an existing integration database; preserve
backups and follow ADR-0036's checksum refusal policy.
